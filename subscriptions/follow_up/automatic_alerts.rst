Set up automatic alerts
=======================

Now that our subscriptions are up and running, we want to stay up-to-date with our customers.
Some automation would be appreciated since we wouldn't want to go through the list of all our
subscribers to check how things are going. This is what our *Automatic alerts* feature is for.

For example, when customers subscribe to your magazine, you probably want to send them an email to
welcome them and express your gratitude. Or, if the satisfaction rate of your customers drops below
50%, you probably want to schedule a call with them to understand the reasons for their dissatisfaction.

With **Odoo Subscriptions**, you can automatically send an email to your customers to welcome them,
you can also create a "Call" task for one of your salespeople so that the seller tries to understand
your customer's dissatisfaction and finally, why not automatically send satisfaction surveys by email
after a month for your clients to evaluate your services? All of that is possible with
**Odoo Subscriptions**.
